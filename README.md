# Cleaning_data_in_MySQL


Project Summary: Customer Order Data Cleaning and Standardisation
This project focused on using SQL to clean and standardise a raw customer order dataset. The goal was to transform messy, inconsistent data into a structured and reliable format suitable for further analysis and reporting.
This analysis reveals the types of data that I have created myself.

Key Insights & Findings:
The analysis uncovered several data inconsistencies that required cleaning, including:
  1. Missing and inconsistent data: The customer_name and email columns contained missing values and inconsistent formatting.
  2. Typographical errors: The quantity column contained non-numeric text ('one', 'two').
  3. Formatting issues: The order_date column had a mix of different date formats (YYYY-MM-DD, MM/DD/YYYY).
  4. Non-standardised categories: product_name, order_status, and country contained inconsistent values and spelling errors ('Pakistan', 'UK', 'CANADA').
